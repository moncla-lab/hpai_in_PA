    "# Running SNPGenie on H5N1 data\n",

    "\n",
    "Popoolation is not a great program for our purposes. I have known this for awhile, but it has always suited our needs well enough that I haven't looked elsewhere. However, now that I would like to do some comparisons of calculating pi at different SNP frequency cutoffs, I need something else. Chase Nelson's program, SNPGenie does this and so I am going to try to get that to work for me. There seem to be a few quirks with it that I will need to work around: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SNPGenie only works on 1 gene segment at a time. This is a huge drag. It needs to be run 8 separate times for 1 influenza genome. I also figured out that for each genome, you need to provide a vcf that contains only sites from that gene, a gtf file with only coordinates for that cds, and a reference fasta with only that sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The vcf format options provided are quite close to what I need, but not quite. Varscan output is almost exactly the same as vcf option 4. The only difference is that SNPGenie assumes AD (allele depth) to be the number of reads supporting the reference base, when in varscan, it supports the number of reads for the alternative allele. Additionally, instead of having the reference base reads in 1 column and the alternative allele reads in another, SNPGenie would like them in the same column, separate by a comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. SNPGenie will not over-write old folders. So if I want everything in 1 folder, I will need to make new names for them as we proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will need to do several things in order to make SNPGenie work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fix the AD column issue/reformat my vcfs to accomodate that change. \n",
    "2. Automate splitting up vcf files, reference fasta files, and gtf files. \n",
    "3. Take care of automatic renaming of folders. "

I think that I am going to try out and see how it looks to just plot the overall number of nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs per nonsynonymous or synonymou site per gene per species. I can read in the number of SNPs from the combined SNPs output file. For the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, I need to count the samples in df (those that had a snp) but also those that did not. I think that the easiest way to do that will be to just run SNPGenie on a set of dummy data so that I can get the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites per gene per sample.  "
